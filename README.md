# FEM-bar-elements
Finite Element Method (FEM) codes for beam, plane frame, and plane truss structures static and modal analysis. Functions for the determination of stiffness and mass matrices are presented, in addition to displacements, nodal forces, and modal parameters (natural frequencies and modal forms) calculus.
